# LOS-Prediction
Prediction of ICU Length of Stay using LSTMs and residual connections

This contains all code for LOS prediction using LSTMs and residual connections
To create the dataset and models, you will need access to the MIMIC-III dataset, this can be done by applying for access at their website and completing the required courses.
The code is broken into 5 folder
1. The code required to build the SAPS II dataset (Dataset A) called 'Dataset A Creation'
2. The code required to build the LOS dataset (Dataset B) called 'Dataset B Creation'
3. The Analysis of the data as decribed in chapter 3 called 'Analysis files'
4. The code for the models used on Dataset A called 'Dataset A models'
5. The code for the models used on Dataset B called 'Dataset B models'
